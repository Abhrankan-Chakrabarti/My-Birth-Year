# My-Birth-Year

A simple Python program that calculates your age based on your birth year.

## How It Works

1. The program prompts the user to enter their birth year.  
2. It converts the input into an integer.  
3. It subtracts the birth year from the current year (2025) to calculate the age.  
4. Finally, it prints the calculated age.  

## Usage

Run the script in a Python environment:  

```sh
python BirthYearcalculator.py
```

### Example

```
Birth Year: 2000  
25
```
